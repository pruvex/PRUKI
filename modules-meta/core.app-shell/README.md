## core.app-shell Module

This module serves as a production-ready, test-driven, dockerized Electron app shell for Pruki. It is designed to be a template for all future modules and can be automatically, error-free, and CI/CD-ready generated by Gemini CLI.

### Requirements & Specifications:

#### 1. Main Process (`main/index.ts`)
- Electron main window (800x600, minimal UI, Title: `Pruki`)
- In Dev mode: Load Vite frontend (`http://localhost:5174`)
- In Prod mode: Load `dist/index.html`
- Secure separation of Main/Renderer context
- Clean error handling and logging

#### 2. IPC Handler (`main/ipc/index.ts`)
- Example IPC handler (`ping`) with console output
- Extensible for other modules
- Export via `registerIpcHandlers(window)`

#### 3. Renderer Frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript)
- Entry point: `renderer/main.tsx`
- Example component: `<div data-testid="app-ready">Pruki is running</div>`
- TailwindCSS for basic styling
- All UI components with stable `data-testid` attributes

#### 4. Vite Configuration
- Output: `dist/`
- Automatically generated `index.html` with bundled assets
- Vite Dev Server runs on Port 5174 (not 5173)

#### 5. package.json
- ESM mode (`type: module`)
- Scripts:
  - `dev`: starts Vite + Electron in parallel (Dev mode)
  - `build`: builds the Vite frontend
  - `start`: starts Electron in Prod mode
- Dependencies: Electron, React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Playwright (for QA)

#### 6. Playwright Test Block (E2E, automated)
- Starts the App with `npm run dev`
- Checks window start and visibility of `data-testid="app-ready"`
- Executes an IPC test (`ping`)
- Closes the App cleanly
- Test coverage for all core functions

#### 7. Docker Integration
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for Dev and Prod
- Installs all dependencies (Node, Electron, Playwright, Vite)
- Starts App and Tests in Container
- Example for Docker Compose
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

#### 8. CI/CD & QA
- Module is fully automated testable
- Playwright tests run in CI/CD
- All Renderer components testable via `data-testid`
- IPC integration prepared for other modules

#### 9. Production Readiness & Extensibility
- Focus on clarity, separation of concerns, modularity
- Clean error handling, logging, QA
- Documentation and example for integration into Pruki

### Important Notes:
- Generate all files, scripts, configurations, and tests so that the module is directly runnable, testable, and CI/CD-ready.
- The implementation must be Gemini CLI/AI Studio compatible and require no rework.
- Adhere to best practices for Electron, React, TypeScript, Playwright, and Docker.
- Document every step and all special features in the module's README.

### Goal:
A production-ready, test-driven Electron app shell for Pruki, serving as a template for all further modules, automatically, error-free, and CI/CD-ready generatable by Gemini.
