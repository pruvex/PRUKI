echo This script would automate the update of test-notes.md.
echo In a real CI/CD pipeline, this would involve:
echo 1. Parsing test results (e.g., from Playwright's JSON report, Vitest's output).
echo 2. Generating a summary of new tests, failures, and coverage.
echo 3. Appending this summary to test-notes.md.
echo 4. Committing and pushing the updated test-notes.md to the repository.

echo For now, this is a placeholder. Manual update of test-notes.md is required.
